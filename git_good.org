* Be safe, or be sorry!
** Why Are Backups Important
*** Recovery
If something happens to your machine, you do not want to lose all your work! This is an even greater problem for coding projects that span =decades=!


*** History
If you want to make experimental changes, it is easier to do so if you know that you can always recover your previous state.

** Ergonomic Backups
The backup process should not interrupt (or significantly slow down) the development process.

* Collaboration
How do you manage a project worked on by tens of people? What about hundreds? What about thousands of developers all making changes to the source code?

* Version Control Systems to the Rescue!
=Version Control Systems= keep track of the history (or different versions) of your project. They solve the ~collaboration~ problem by being able to support different versions (or =branches=) of the source code.

#+begin_example
groceries.txt (John's branch):
> milk
> flour

groceries.txt (Bob's branch):
> milk
> flour
> tomatoes
#+end_example

When developers are ready to =merge= two branches, the version control system allows them to do so.

#+begin_example
groceries.txt (John's branch, after Bob merged his changes):
> milk
> flour
> tomatoes
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
If the changes cannot be automagically applied, a merge conflict will arise. The developer needs to resolve the merge conflict in order to successfully merge the branches.
#+end_quote

The most popular version control system today, and the topic of today's workshop is...

* Git
#+begin_quote
FUN FACT: Git was created by Linus Torvalds to manage the development of Linux! So if Git is good enough for Linux, it is probably good enough for you!
#+end_quote

** Back to the Basics
Git keeps track of your history in the =.git= directory. The directory in which =.git= is located is called the =root project directory=. You need only one =.git= file per project and that is fully managed by Git itself.

Your entire source code is referred to as a =repository=. The repository on your machine is the ~local repository~, but if you upload your code to the cloud (see below), then the cloud repository will be referred to as the =git repository=.

Git is managed by the _git_ command: [[https://github.com/git-guides/install-git][Install Git Guide]]

** Let's Git Going!
#+begin_src shell
    # Go to the directory which you want git to track
    cd example_dir

    # Initialize directory to be a git directory (creates .git directory)
    git init

    # 🧑‍💻
    touch groceries.txt
    echo -e "milk\neggs\nflour" > groceries.txt

    # (optional) Check changes made in git repo
    git status

    # Add your changes to git
    # (the dot means everything in the current directory and subdirectories)
    git add .

    # (optional) If you want to add only a certain file
    git add <name of file>

    # Commit your changes (or associate a message with your changes)
    git commit -m "your message here"

    # Next Step: syncing with the cloud
#+end_src

* Sync to the Hub...the GitHub
** What is "the Cloud"
You can think of the =cloud= as a computer that is always on (i.e. a server) managed by someone, somewhere in the world. Since the cloud is (almost) always up and running, you should be able to access your files at any time (think OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).

** Github, the Developer's Cloud Storage
- Upload / download code
- Inspect code (syntax highlighting)
- Automated testing of the code
- Management of projects (issue lists, wikis, etc.)
- etc.


Github is the industry standard, but not the only option:
- Gitlab
- CodeBucket
- Gitea


** Hosting Your Own Code Repository Server
If you have a spare computer around you can host your own =code repository server=. Some pre-built options are:
- Gitlab
- Gitea


** Git Syncing!
*** Prerequisites (for Github)
- Github account with an [[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent][SSH key]]
- Github repository
  
*** Prerequisites (in general)
- Local git repo

*** Ready, Set, Sync!
#+begin_src shell
  # Be inside your local git repo
  cd example_dir

  # Assuming you have committed changes...

  # Add remote (or the server repo's link)
  git remote add origin <repo link here>

  # Push your changes to the default branch
  git push

  # (option) If you want to push to another branch
  git push origin <branch name>
#+end_src

*** Downloading Your Source Code
Let's say your computer was destroyed by an alien invasion, or perhaps more simply you want to share your code on your friend Bob's computer, how would you do that?

**** Downloading Everything from Scratch
#+begin_src shell
  git clone <repo link>
#+end_src

**** Updating Your Local Repo
If you already have the repo on your machine and you just want to update it to any changes that someone has made, this option is for you.

#+begin_src shell
  # Make sure you are in the git directory
  cd example_dir

  # (optional) Check if there are any updates, but does not update
  git fetch

  # Update repo with new changes
  git pull

  # (option) Update repo with changes from another branch (git will try to merge)
  git pull origin <other branch>
#+end_src

* Groceries: A Practical Example
#+begin_src shell
  # Create empty directory
  mkdir groceries

  cd groceries

  git init

  touch groceries.txt

  git add .
  git commit -m "created groceries file"
  # we are not syncing to github in this example, but if we wanted to:
  # git remote add origin <repo url>
  # git pull remote origin
  # git push -u origin master
#+end_src

Current state of our git repo:
#+attr_latex: :environment verbatim
#+begin_example
        "created groceries file"
master: ------o
#+end_example

Let's add our groceries:
#+begin_src
  git switch -c my_groceries
  echo -e "milk\neggs" > groceries.txt

  git add .
  git commit -m "added my groceries"
#+end_src

But at the same time Mark Zuckerberg adds his groceries to the same list (from his branch, so that we can make changes at the same time):
#+begin_src shell
  # Start from master branch
  git switch master
  
  git switch -c zuck_groceries
  echo -e "milk\nlizard_juice" > groceries.txt

  git add .
  git commit -m "zuck groceries"
#+end_src

The state of our git repo looks like this:
#+attr_latex: :environment verbatim
#+begin_example
        "created groceries file"
master: -----------o
                    \ "added my groceries"
my_groceries         o----------------
                
                    \ "zuck groceries"
zuck_groceries:      o----------------
#+end_example

As you can see, we have three different versions of the same file in different ~branches~ (_master_, _my_groceries_, _zuck_groceries_). Now lets combine (or =merge=) all our changes.

First _my_groceries_ to _master_:
#+begin_src shell
  # Make sure we are on the right branch
  # (notice that -c is needed only when creating a new branch)
  git switch master

  # Merge to master from my_groceries (use git rebase, not git merge)
  git rebase my_groceries

  # (optional) If we merging from the cloud:
  # git rebase origin my_groceries
#+end_src


The state of our git repo looks like this:
#+attr_latex: :environment verbatim
#+begin_example
        "created groceries file"
master: -----------o                              o--------------
                    \ "added my groceries"       /
my_groceries         o---------------------------
                
                    \ "zuck groceries"
zuck_groceries:      o-------------------------------------------
#+end_example


Now _zuck_groceries_ (*WARNING!* This will result in a =merge conflict=):
#+begin_src shell
  git merge zuck_groceries

  # We will get merge conflicts
  git mergetool
#+end_src

The conflict is in line 2:

#+caption: groceries.txt (master)
#+begin_src shell -n
  milk
  eggs
#+end_src

#+caption: groceries.txt (zuck_groceries)
#+begin_src shell -n
  milk
  lizard_juice
#+end_src


** Rebasing
What happens if you are working on your branch, but someone committed changes to the ~master~ branch which you need in order to finish your work? Well... you use [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHcfoHOW4uA][rebase]].

Continuing with our example:
#+begin_src shell
  # Delete the old branches (my_groceries and zuck_groceries)
  git switch master
  git branch -D my_groceries zuck_groceries

  # Now let's create a new branch
  git switch -c shopkeeper
#+end_src

Suppose that the person working on the ~shopkeeper~ branch is waiting for changes in the ~master~ branch to finish his work. In this example, we will assume that the change is the creation of a file called ~counter.txt~.

#+begin_src shell
  # Create the counter.txt file in master
  git switch master
  touch counter.txt

  git add .
  git commit -m "created counter.txt"
#+end_src

However, while ~counter.txt~ is being added, the ~shopkeeper~ makes some changes:
#+begin_src shell
  git switch shopkeeper
  echo -e "prices:\neggs = 0.5\nmilk=2" > prices.txt

  git add .
  git commit -m "created prices.txt"
#+end_src

The current state of our repo is:
#+attr_latex: :environment verbatim
#+begin_example
                 "created counter.txt"
master: ... --------------o-------
                    \ 
shopkeeper:          ---o---------
                 "created prices.txt"
#+end_example

Before the ~shopkeeper~ can commit the changes, they would need the file ~counter.txt~. This is where *rebase* comes in:

#+begin_src shell
  git switch shopkeeper
  git rebase master
#+end_src

Here's what *rebase* does:
1. Saves your commits made after the divergence from ~master~
2. Applies the commits from the ~master~ branch
3. Re-applies your saved commits on top


This is what our repo looks like now:
#+attr_latex: :environment verbatim
#+begin_example
                 "created counter.txt"
master: ... --------------o------------------------------------
                    \      \ REBASE \
shopkeeper:          ----------------o--------------------------------o---------
                "created counter.txt"        "created prices.txt"
#+end_example

Now, the ~shopkeeper~ has successfully incorporated changes from *upstream* while keeping their branch commits.

** Rolling Back
What happens if you make a mistake and you want to go back to a previous commit? Use ~git reset~:
#+begin_src shell
  # Use --soft if you want to move to a previous commit but keep your changes staged
  git reset --soft <commit hash>

  # Use --hard if you want to discard all changes and return to the exact state of the previous commit
  git reset --hard <commit hash>
#+end_src

You can get the commit hash by any of the following methods:
#+begin_src shell
  git log
  git log --oneline
  git log --oneline --graph
#+end_src

** Stashing
Imagine you made some changes, but you are not ready to commit them. Now you want to rebase (pull) some changes from upstream. The problem is that for rebase (pull) to work, you would need your local changes to be committed. A way to mitigate this is to use the *stash*.

The stash is like a bin, where you can "throw" your changes into. You can do so with ~git stash~. If you want to bring back the latest changes from the stash: ~git stash pop~.

To list the changes in stash: ~git stash list~.

If you wish to get rid of everything in your stash (you will not be able to recover them later): ~git stash clear~.

* Do You Git It Now?
No? Then practice!

* Git Policy for Bricked-Up (Backend)
** Branch Policy
- Each new feature / fix is its own branch
- Commit freely to that branch
- Developers submit pull requests (PRs) to =dev= branch ([[*Commit Message Prefix][meaningful]] commit message)
- Lead must [[*PR Approval Criteria][review]] all PRs, before they are merged into =dev=
- Lead is responsible for making sure =dev= works before merging with =master=
- *NOTE*: Only =dev= merges with =master=


#+begin_quote
TIP: Do not be afraid of commits! Commit your changes often! That's what they are for! For the purposes of our team, only the final commit (a.k.a. the PR commit) message must be properly structured! 
#+end_quote

** PR Approval Criteria
Here are the criteria the PR must adhere to in order to be accepted:
- No merge conflicts
- All tests are passing
- No junk files are present (e.g. ~.vscode~)
- Directory hierarchy is followed
- PR commit message is [[*Commit Message Prefix][properly structured]]
  
** Commit Message Prefix
This applies to final commits (i.e. commits when merging):
- *feat(<feature>)*: description
- *refactor(<feature>)*: description
- *fix(<feature>):* description
- *hotfix(<bug>)*: description
- *bug(<bug>)*: description
- *tests(<feature>)*: description
- *misc*: description
- *docs*: description
- *update*: description

#+caption: Example merge commit message.
#+begin_example
feat(login): created login endpoint
#+end_example

** Merging and Rebasing Policy
- *Squash merge* if your feature is ready to be merged upstream!
- *Rebase* if you are still working on your code, but you need to pull the latest changes!
